# Victorian Plumbing Tech Test

This project is a simple e-commerce web application, allowing users to view a curated list of products with optional filtering features. The filters dynamically update based on user selections, enhancing the overall browsing experience.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command launches the application in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to the specified local server (usually http://localhost:3000) to view and interact with the application.


## Features and Accomplishments

### What’s Been Done Well:
- **Product Listing:** Users can view a selection of products, each displayed with essential details.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Optional filtering by price and style has been implemented, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Dynamic Count:** Filter counters display dynamic counts for each price and style, updating in real-time based on selected filters.
- **Contextual Filtering:** When a price range is selected, the style filter automatically updates to show only the styles available within that price range, enhancing filter relevance and usability.

These features collectively offer a responsive and streamlined product browsing experience.

## Areas for Improvement
To further enhance the user experience, a few potential improvements have been identified:

### Sorting Capabilities:
Enable sorting options for:
- **Price:** low-to-high and high-to-low
- **Discount:** largest discount first
- **Recommended:** default setting

### Enhanced Styling and Branding:
- Update CSS to give the webpage a more modern look and feel.
- Apply color schemes and branding elements that align with the current Victorian Plumbing aesthetic.

### Extended Filtering Options:

### Pagination:
- Add pagination to showcase a broader range of products, aligning the webpage with MVP standards for an improved browsing experience.

These improvements aim to elevate the application’s functionality, aesthetics, and usability, creating a comprehensive, user-friendly, and visually appealing product selection platform.
